# explain a 3 tier architecture that you implemented

**Can you explain a 3-tier architecture that you implemented in your recent project?**

Sure, I can walk you through a 3-tier setup I worked on about 8 months ago. It was for this e-commerce website that was getting hammered during sales events.

**What we built :**

So basically, I had to  set up the whole thing from scratch. The frontend was a React app - nothing too fancy, just clean user interface stuff. The backend was Node.js with some Java microservices thrown in for the heavy lifting like payment processing. And for the database, we went with PostgreSQL for the main data and MongoDB for product catalogs.

**The setup :**

I put everything on AWS because that's what the company was already using. We had the web servers in public subnets, application servers in private subnets, and databases in their own isolated subnets. Pretty standard stuff, but it works.

**Frontend layer :**\
This is where users actually see and click things. I used React with some state management, and put everything behind a CDN so people around the world could load pages faster. The whole thing was containerized with Docker and deployed on EKS.

**Backend layer:**\
This is where all the business logic happens. When someone adds something to their cart or tries to pay, this layer figures out what to do. I had Node.js handling the API calls and Java services doing the heavy calculations. Everything talks to each other through REST APIs.

**Database layer:**\
This is where all the data lives. Customer info, product details, order history - all that stuff. I set up PostgreSQL with read replicas so when lots of people are browsing products, it doesn't slow down the main database.

**The tricky parts:**

The biggest headache was when we launched and suddenly had 10 times more users than expected. The database connections were maxing out, so I had to quickly set up connection pooling. Also, our Docker images were huge - like 2GB each - which made deployments super slow. I spent a weekend optimising them down to about 600MB using multi-stage builds.

**How I handled the load:**

I set up auto-scaling so when CPU usage goes above 70%, it automatically spins up more servers. For the database, I configured read replicas and set up Redis for caching frequently accessed data like product lists

**Monitoring:**

I used Prometheus for metrics and Grafana for dashboards. Set up alerts so if anything goes wrong, I get notified immediately. Also integrated with ELK stack for log analysis because when things break, you need to know what happened

**Security:**

Everything talks to each other through private networks. Database is completely isolated from the internet. All API calls go through authentication, and we encrypted everything both in transit and at rest

**The results:**

After everything was running smoothly, we could handle Black Friday traffic without any issues. Page load times went from 3-4 seconds to under 1 second. Deployments went from taking 20 minutes to about 5 minutes. And the best part - no more late night calls when something crashes

The whole thing took about 6 weeks to build and another 2 weeks to fine-tune. But now when the business wants to add new features, we can deploy them without worrying about breaking everything else. Each layer can be updated independently, which makes life much easier
