# Sample project structure

### Detailed Project Architecture and Technical Details

### 1. **Kubernetes Cluster Setup**

* **Control Plane (Master Nodes):**
  * The AWS EKS managed control plane runs **3 master nodes**, distributed automatically across **3 Availability Zones (AZs)** for high availability.
  * This multi-AZ setup ensures that if one AZ fails, the Kubernetes API server and control plane components remain available without disruption.
* **Worker Nodes:**
  * The cluster has multiple worker nodes spread evenly across the same 3 AZs.
  * Typical node count depends on workload but for 25 microservices, a common sizing is **10–15 nodes** to handle load and redundancy.
  * Node type used: AWS **t3.medium** or **t3.large** instances, balancing cost and resource needs (CPU, memory).
  * Nodes are part of **Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs)** spanning multiple AZs for automatic replacement and capacity scaling.

***

### 2. **Microservices Setup**

* The system consists of approximately **25 independent microservices**, deployed in Kubernetes pods.
* Each microservice runs with **3–5 replicas**, scheduled to run on different nodes and AZs using **pod anti-affinity** rules to avoid co-locating replicas.
* Each pod is configured with:
  * Resource requests and limits, e.g., **0.5 to 1 CPU and 512Mi to 1Gi memory** per pod.
  * **Liveness and readiness probes** to monitor health and manage restarts.
  * Shared volumes mounted for sidecar containers (used mostly for logging).

***

### 3. **Security**

* **Network Security:**
  * **AWS Security Groups** restrict inbound traffic:
    * ALB Security Group allows inbound **HTTP 80** and **HTTPS 443** from public internet or trusted IPs only.
    * Worker node Security Groups allow traffic only from the ALB on allowed ports (e.g., 8080 for apps).
    * Database Security Group restricts MySQL port **3306** access exclusively to the IP ranges of Kubernetes worker nodes.
  * **Kubernetes Network Policies** are applied:
    * To restrict pod-to-pod communication, allowing only necessary microservices to talk.
    * To block unauthorized lateral access within the cluster.
* **Secrets Management:**
  * HashiCorp Vault is integrated for secure secrets storage.
  * Kubernetes pods and EC2 instances authenticate to Vault to retrieve **dynamic, short-lived secrets** for databases, API keys, and certificates.
  * No secrets are stored in pod specs or container images, minimizing leak risks.
* **Ingress Security:**
  * TLS termination is handled at ALB or the Ingress controller with certificates managed via **AWS Certificate Manager**.
  * Rate limiting and IP whitelisting can be configured via ALB or API Gateway.

***

### 4. **High Availability**

* **Cluster HA:**
  * Multi-AZ EKS control plane and worker nodes ensure availability even if an AZ fails.
  * Kubernetes health checks restart unhealthy pods and reschedule them across healthy nodes.
  * Pod anti-affinity rules distribute replicas across nodes and AZs to avoid single points of failure.
* **Database HA:**
  * MySQL runs on EC2 instances configured with **multi-AZ replication** for failover.
  * If the primary node or AZ fails, failover mechanisms switch traffic to replicas in other AZs.
  * Connection pooling in microservices efficiently manages DB connections and reduces load spikes.
* **Load Balancing & Traffic Failover:**
  * AWS ALB spreads external traffic across pods in all AZs.
  * It performs health checks and directs traffic away from failed pods or nodes.
  * Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) scales pods in response to CPU and custom metrics to maintain performance during demand spikes.

***

### 5. **Communication Between Microservices**

* Primarily uses **RESTful APIs** over HTTP/HTTPS for synchronous communication.
* For some latency-sensitive or internal communication, **gRPC** or message queues like **Kafka** or **RabbitMQ** are also used.
* All communication occurs within a secured Kubernetes networking layer, enhanced by network policies for limiting access tightly.
* **Service discovery** is managed automatically by Kubernetes DNS, allowing services to find each other dynamically.
* API Gateway or Ingress routes external and inter-service calls securely.

***

### 6. **Logging and Monitoring**

* Application logs are handled by a **sidecar container** within each pod, which reads logs off a **shared volume** where the main app writes.
* These logs are forwarded to a centralized logging system such as **ELK Stack** or a managed logging service.
* Metrics are collected using **Prometheus** and visualized with **Grafana** dashboards.
* Distributed tracing tools like **Jaeger** or **Zipkin** may be deployed for analyzing request flows across microservices.

### Real-Time Project Description with Practical Details

Your project is a **microservices-based application running on AWS using EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**, designed for real-world scalability, availability, and security used in production-grade setups.

***

### Cluster Architecture & Infrastructure

* **Control Plane (Masters):**\
  AWS EKS provides a **fully managed control plane** deployed across **3 Availability Zones (AZs)** to guarantee high availability. You don’t manage master nodes directly, but AWS ensures redundancy and automatic failover.
* **Worker Nodes:**\
  Typically, you run around **10–15 worker nodes** of **t3.medium or t3.large EC2 instances**, spread evenly across these AZs.\
  Nodes are grouped in **Auto Scaling Groups** to automatically handle capacity scaling and fault recovery in real-time.
* **Microservices:**\
  There are **25+ independent microservices**, each running as multiple pod replicas (usually 3–5) for resilience.\
  Replicas are scheduled with **pod anti-affinity rules** to ensure no two replicas of the same service run on the same node or AZ, reducing downtime risk during failures.

***

### Real Production-Level Security

* **Network Security:**\
  Use **AWS Security Groups** tightly controlling traffic—only allow HTTP/HTTPS to your ALB, and restrict access to backend pods and databases.\
  Inside Kubernetes, **Network Policies** enforce zero-trust communication, allowing microservices only to talk to their required counterparts.
* **Secrets Management:**\
  Instead of hardcoding secrets or environment variables, **HashiCorp Vault** is integrated, delivering dynamic and short-lived secrets to your pods and EC2 instances at runtime, reducing risk from secret leakage.
* **Ingress & Traffic Control:**\
  Real-time traffic enters through an **AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)** configured with TLS termination, security policies, and routing rules mapped to Kubernetes Ingress resources.\
  This ALB handles failover, health checks, and scales automatically with demand.

***

### High Availability & Failover in Practice

* **Multi-AZ Deployment:**\
  Your nodes and control plane span 3 AZs. If one AZ fails due to hardware or network issues, the system automatically fails over. Kubernetes reschedules pods in healthy AZs, and ALB routes traffic accordingly without downtime.
* **Database Resilience:**\
  MySQL runs on EC2 with **multi-AZ replication** enabled. In failover events, replica promotion ensures your transactional database remains available with minimal manual intervention.
* **Scaling:**\
  Using **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)** based on CPU and custom metrics, your microservices automatically increase or reduce replicas in response to real customer load in production.

***

### Communication & Logging

* **Service Communication:**\
  Microservices communicate primarily via REST APIs and asynchronous messaging (like Kafka or RabbitMQ), a pattern proven to scale well and decouple services in production.\
  Service discovery and load balancing are handled automatically by Kubernetes DNS and Services.
* **Logging with Sidecar:**\
  Application pods include a **sidecar container** running Fluentd or a similar agent. Logs are written by the main app to a shared volume and forwarded by the sidecar in real time to a centralized log aggregator like ELK or a cloud log service.\
  This approach is standard practice to separate concerns and enable high-quality observability without impacting app performance.
* **Monitoring & Alerting:**\
  Prometheus and Grafana dashboards monitor service health and performance, while alerting systems notify your ops team about incidents, ensuring quick resolution and uptime.

***

### Why This Setup Reflects Real-Time Production Systems

* **Managed control plane:** Reduces operational burden—used by most organizations with EKS.
* **Multi-AZ deployment:** Industry-standard for ensuring no single point of failure.
