# Git Version Control

***

***

Version Control System (VCS) is a software system that records changes to a file or set of files over time, enabling software developers to work together collaboratively and maintain a complete history of their work.

A Version Control System (VCS) provides the following features.

* Collaboration - Allows for the simultaneous work between multiple developers on a single project and a seamless integration of modifications.
* Version Control - Maintains track of all changes performed, enabling rollbacks to earlier iterations while providing a development history.
* Conflict Resolution - Recognizes and assists in resolving conflicts resulting from simultaneous editing.
* Backup and Security - Maintains an audit trace, manages access, and functions as a safe backup system.
* Transparency - Gives a clear picture of the modifications made, by whom, and when.
* Efficiency - Speeds up project completion, streamlines procedures, and makes communication smoother.

### Types of Version Control Systems (VCS)

The following is the list of types of VCS.

* Manual Version Control (Copying Files)
* Local Version Control Systems
* Centralized Version Control Systems
* Distributed Version Control Systems

### Manual Version Control (Copying Files)

Common technique - Files are frequently copied to new directories, perhaps with timestamps added for organization.

#### Disadvantages

* Easily forgets the current directory and copies or overwrites the incorrect file, making it prone to errors.
* It is challenging to follow history or go back to earlier iterations when there is no central record of changes.

### Local Version Control Systems

The purpose of a local version control system, or VCS, was to overcome the drawbacks of manual techniques.

#### Advantages

* Database - Maintains a history of file modifications.
*   Revision control - This enables you to keep track of particular file versions and roll them back when necessary.

    One such tool is the widely used revision control system (RCS), which records changes as patch sets (differences between files).
* Patch sets - These are saved on disk and, by applying the appropriate patches one after the other, enable the reconstruction of any previous version of a file.

#### Disadvantage

* Not ideal for collaboration - Local systems make it difficult for several developers to collaborate on a single project while using separate machines.

### Centralized Version Control Systems

It is designed to address problems with collaboration. All project files are stored on the central server.

Developer workstations connected to the server to retrieve files for editing are called clients.

#### Advantages -

The following are advantages of centralized VCS.

* Improved collaboration - All users have access to the most recent versions and can observe each other's work.
* Simple administration - Compared to many local configurations, it is easier to manage the system and restrict who can do what.

#### Disadvantages -

The following are disadvantages of centralized VCS.

* Single point of failure - No one can work together or save changes if the main server breaks.
* Risk of data loss - Unless backups are performed well, the entire project history may be lost if the primary database becomes corrupted.
* Comparable risk to local VCS - Any system that stores all of its project history in one location runs the risk of being completely lost.

### Distributed Version Control Systems

DVCSs distribute the project's history instead of relying on a single server.

Each developer working on the project has a complete copy (clone) of all files and their entire change history on their local machine.

#### Advantages of DVCS -

The following are advantages of DVCS.

* Decentralized backup - Every clone acts as a full backup. Recovery from server failure is easy by copying any clone back to the server.
* Offline work - Developers can work without the need to connect to the internet with a local copy. Especially useful for those with unreliable connections.
* Efficient operations - Tasks like history viewing and changes are faster due to local copies.
* Multiple remote repositories for collaboration - DVCSs support working with several remote repositories.

### Git Version Control

Git is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) that monitors modifications made to files in different versions.

By enabling several developers to work on a project at once, it improves collaboration.

Its dependability and efficiency promote smooth contribution, management and integration.

#### Features of Git Version Control

The following are some of the key features of Git Version Control.

**Branching and Merging**

With Git, developers can easily create separate branches for various features or bug fixes and then smoothly merge those branches back into the main project.

**Distributed Architecture**

Every developer has a complete local copy of the repository, along with all of its history.

**Staging Area**

Before committing changes to the repository, Git offers a staging area for evaluation.

**Data Integrity**

Git ensures data integrity with SHA-1 hashing. Each directory, file, and commit is checksummed.

**Fast Performance**

Since Git activities like commits, diffs, and merges are done locally, they happen very quickly.

#### Advantages of Git Version Control

The following are some of the key advantages of Git Version Control.

**Enhanced Collaboration**

Git's branching model enables simultaneous work on various features by numerous developers without causing conflicts.

Code reviews and pull requests help to promote teamwork.

**Flexibility**

Git can accommodate varied project needs by supporting a variety of workflows, including feature branching, Gitflow, and trunk-based development.

**Offline Work**

With a local copy of the repository, developers may work offline, which is particularly helpful for people with erratic internet connections.

**Decentralized Backup**

Each clone functions as a complete backup. Restoring any clone back to the server makes recovering from server failure simple.

**Extensive Tools and Environment**

Numerous solutions for project management, continuous integration, and deployment are integrated with Git.

**Community and Support**

Git has a large user and contributor community that offers lots of documentation, tools, and assistance.
