# Scripts 1

#### Bash Script (`memorycheck.sh`)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Fetch disk usage percentage for the current directory
space=$(df -h . | tail -1 | awk '{print $(NF-1)}' | tr -d '%')

echo "Consumed disk space is ${space}%"

# Check if disk usage is greater than or equal to 90%
if [ "$space" -ge 90 ]; then
    echo "Disk space is more than 90%. Please take appropriate action." \
    | mail -s "Alert: Disk Space Exceeded 90%" -c "abc@gmail.com" "abc@gmail.com"
fi
```

#### Notes:

* `tr -d '%'` is preferred over `sed 's/%/ /g'` for removing `%`.
* Wrapped variables in double quotes for safety.
* Added a proper subject for the email alert.
* Improved message readability.
