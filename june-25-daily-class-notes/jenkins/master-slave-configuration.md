## Jenkins Master and Slave configuration

### 🧰 Prerequisites

1. Jenkins server
2. Slave server with Java installation

### Procedure:



1. Goto Manage Nodes
   * Manage Jenkins --> Manage Nodes and Clouds --> New Node
2. Add the node name as Permanent Agent
3.  Provide below information to add Jenkins agent\
    **Name:** uniquely identifies an agent within this Jenkins installation\
    **Description:**\
    **Number of executors:** 2\
    **Remote root directory:** /home/ec2-user/maven-agent\
    **Labels:** Labels (or tags) are used to group multiple agents into one logical group.\
    **Usage:**

    * Use this node as much as possible
    * Only build jobs with label expressions matching this node

    **Launch method:**

    * Launch agent by connecting it to the master
    * Launch agent via execution of command on the controller

    **Custom WorkDir path:** custom Remoting work directory will be used instead of the Agent Root Directory\
    &#xNAN;**- Use WebSocket \[x]**\
    **Availability:**

    * Keep this agent online as much as possible
    * Bring this agent online according to a schedule
    * Bring this agent online when in demand, and take offline when idle
4.  Once you save above configuration you will get a command which should be executed in the agent. it contains agent.jar, a secret-file, and a jnlp file

    ```
      echo "secret_key" > secret-file
      java -jar agent.jar -jnlpUrl http://<Jenkins_URL>/computer/abc/jenkins-agent.jnlp -secret @secret-file -workDir "/home/ec2-user"
    ```
5. Once connected you can create or edit a job to chose this option in the `Restrict where this project can be run`
