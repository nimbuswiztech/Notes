# Terraform Modules

A Terraform module is a collection of Terraform configuration files that are grouped together to represent a specific unit of infrastructure. Modules can be used to define things like virtual machines, databases, or load balancers. They can also be used to define more complex infrastructure, such as a complete web application stack.

Modules are a powerful way to improve the reusability and maintainability of Terraform configurations. By defining common infrastructure components in modules, you can avoid duplicating code and make it easier to make changes to your infrastructure. Modules can also be used to create logical abstractions of your infrastructure, making it easier to understand and manage.

To write a Terraform module, you first need to create a directory for the module. Inside the directory, you will need to create one or more Terraform configuration files. These files will define the resources that the module creates.

The most important file in a module is the `main.tf` file. This file defines the entry point for the module and is where you will typically define the module's inputs and outputs. The `main.tf` file also contains the `terraform` block, which specifies the provider that the module will use.
