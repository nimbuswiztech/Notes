# Proxy - Forward and reverse

### What is a Proxy? <a href="#what-is-a-proxy" id="what-is-a-proxy"></a>

A **proxy server** is an intermediary server that acts as a gateway between clients (users) and the internet. Instead of connecting directly to websites or services, your requests first go through the proxy server, which then forwards them to the destination on your behalf. The proxy server has its own IP address and essentially acts as a middleman, providing various benefits including enhanced security, privacy, and performance optimization.

### How Proxy Servers Work <a href="#how-proxy-servers-work" id="how-proxy-servers-work"></a>

When you use a proxy server, the communication flow works as follows:

1. **User Request**: You enter a website URL in your browser
2. **Proxy Intercepts**: The proxy server receives your request first
3. **Request Forwarding**: The proxy forwards your request to the destination web server
4. **Server Response**: The web server sends its response back to the proxy server
5. **Response Delivery**: The proxy forwards the response back to you

Throughout this process, the destination server only sees the proxy's IP address, not your actual IP address, providing a layer of anonymity.

### Forward Proxy <a href="#forward-proxy" id="forward-proxy"></a>

### Definition and Function

A **forward proxy** (also simply called a "proxy server") sits between client devices and the internet. It acts on behalf of clients, intercepting outbound requests and forwarding them to external servers. The forward proxy is what most people think of when they hear "proxy server".

### Key Characteristics of Forward Proxies

| Aspect               | Description                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Position**         | Between clients and the internet                                    |
| **Client Awareness** | Clients must configure their devices to use the proxy               |
| **Primary Function** | Controls and manages outbound traffic from internal networks        |
| **Visibility**       | Server sees requests coming from the proxy, not the original client |

### Forward Proxy Use Cases

**Enhanced Security and Privacy**:

* Hides client IP addresses from external servers
* Provides anonymity for users
* Blocks access to malicious websites
* Filters potentially harmful content

**Access Control and Policy Enforcement**:

* Companies can block access to inappropriate websites
* Enforce acceptable use policies
* Monitor employee internet usage
* Control bandwidth consumption

**Content Access**:

* Bypass geo-restrictions and censorship
* Access blocked websites
* Enable users to reach content not available in their region

**Performance Optimization**:

* Cache frequently accessed content
* Reduce bandwidth usage
* Improve response times for common requests

### Reverse Proxy <a href="#reverse-proxy" id="reverse-proxy"></a>

### Definition and Function

A **reverse proxy** sits in front of web servers and acts on behalf of the server, not the client. It intercepts incoming requests from clients and forwards them to appropriate backend servers. Unlike forward proxies, clients are typically unaware that they're communicating through a reverse proxy.

### Key Characteristics of Reverse Proxies

| Aspect               | Description                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Position**         | Between the internet and web servers          |
| **Client Awareness** | Clients are typically unaware of the proxy    |
| **Primary Function** | Protects and optimizes server-side operations |
| **Configuration**    | Server-side configuration, not client-side    |

### Reverse Proxy Use Cases

**Load Balancing**:

* Distributes incoming requests across multiple backend servers
* Prevents any single server from becoming overwhelmed
* Ensures high availability and fault tolerance
* Improves overall system scalability

**Caching and Performance**:

* Caches static and dynamic content
* Serves cached responses without hitting backend servers
* Reduces server load and improves response times
* Optimizes bandwidth usage

**Security Enhancement**:

* Hides backend server details from clients
* Protects against direct attacks on origin servers
* Acts as a firewall layer
* Provides DDoS protection

**SSL/TLS Management**:

* Handles SSL encryption and decryption
* Offloads cryptographic processing from backend servers
* Centralizes certificate management
* Reduces computational overhead on application servers

Proxies play an important role in managing data flow between clients and servers. Both forward proxies and reverse proxies are used in different ways to help control and optimize this flow.

* **Forward Proxy:** Acts on behalf of the client to enhance privacy and control access.
* **Reverse Proxy:** Acts on behalf of the server to optimize performance and security.

### Forward Vs Reverse Proxy <a href="#difference-between-forward-and-reverse-proxy" id="difference-between-forward-and-reverse-proxy"></a>

Here is a detailed comparison of Forward and Proxy Proxy based on various features:

| **Forward Proxy**                                                      | **Reverse Proxy**                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Acts on behalf of the client to control access and enhance privacy.    | Acts on behalf of the server to optimize performance and improve security.         |
| Sits between the client and the internet.                              | Sits between the internet and the server.                                          |

| The client needs to configure their device to use the proxy.           | The server is configured to use the reverse proxy.                                 |
| Bypassing content filters, controlling access, privacy enhancement.    | Load balancing, caching, DDoS protection, SSL offloading.                          |
| Intercepts requests from the client to the internet and forwards them. | Intercepts requests from the internet and forwards them to the appropriate server. |
| Can cache content on the client side to improve response times.        | Can cache server responses to reduce load and speed up content delivery.           |
| Does not typically handle SSL/TLS encryption.                          | Can handle SSL/TLS offloading, easing encryption/decryption tasks for the server.  |

### What is a Forward Proxy? <a href="#what-is-a-forward-proxy" id="what-is-a-forward-proxy"></a>

A forward proxy (also called a "proxy server") is a server that sits between client devices and the internet. When a client sends a request to access a website or online resource, the request is directed to the forward proxy first. The proxy then forwards the request to the destination server on behalf of the client.

#### Usage of Forward Proxy <a href="#usage-of-forward-proxy" id="usage-of-forward-proxy"></a>

* Enhancing client anonymity
* Accessing geo-blocked or restricted content
* Content filtering and monitoring in organizations
* Reducing bandwidth consumption through caching
* Logging and tracking user activity for compliance

### What is a Reverse Proxy? <a href="#what-is-a-reverse-proxy" id="what-is-a-reverse-proxy"></a>

A reverse proxy works the opposite of a forward proxy. While a forward proxy acts on behalf of the client, a reverse proxy acts on behalf of the server. It is used to protect and manage servers by ensuring that clients do not directly communicate with the origin server.

#### Use Cases of Reverse Proxy <a href="#use-cases-of-reverse-proxy" id="use-cases-of-reverse-proxy"></a>

* Load balancing across multiple web servers
* Caching content to improve server performance
* Protecting backend servers from direct exposure to the internet
* SSL/TLS offloading to improve server efficiency
* Mitigating DDoS attacks and enhancing security
