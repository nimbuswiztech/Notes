# VPC Components

### What is AWS VPC? <a href="#what-is-aws-vpc" id="what-is-aws-vpc"></a>

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a **logically isolated section** of the AWS cloud where you can launch and manage AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. VPC provides complete control over your virtual networking environment, including **IP address range selection**, **subnet creation**, **routing configuration**, and **network gateways**. It enables you to build a secure and scalable network that mirrors traditional on-premises infrastructure while leveraging cloud flexibility.

### Core VPC Components <a href="#core-vpc-components" id="core-vpc-components"></a>

### VPC and IP Addressing

A VPC is defined by its **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) block**, which determines the range of IP addresses available within the network. The VPC can support both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing, with a maximum /16 IPv4 CIDR block providing up to 65,536 addresses. When creating a VPC, AWS automatically generates a **default route table** and **default security group**.

### Subnets: Network Segmentation

**Subnets are range of IP addresses within your VPC** that allow you to organize and deploy resources in different Availability Zones. Each subnet must reside entirely within **one Availability Zone** and cannot span zones. This design ensures high availability and fault tolerance by distributing resources across multiple physical locations.

### Subnet Types

Subnets are categorized based on their routing configuration:

| Subnet Type         | Description                                | Internet Access                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Public Subnet**   | Has a route to an Internet Gateway         | Direct internet access           |
| **Private Subnet**  | No direct route to Internet Gateway        | Requires NAT for internet access |
| **VPN-only Subnet** | Routes only to Site-to-Site VPN connection | VPN connectivity only            |
| **Isolated Subnet** | No routes to destinations outside VPC      | VPC-internal communication only  |

### Internet Gateway (IGW)

An **Internet Gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component** that enables communication between your VPC and the internet. It supports both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic without causing availability risks or bandwidth constraints. For IPv4 communication, the Internet Gateway performs **Network Address Translation (NAT)** by logically providing one-to-one NAT on behalf of instances.

Key characteristics of Internet Gateways:

* **No additional charges** for the gateway itself
* **Horizontally scaled** for high availability
* **Performs NAT** for IPv4 traffic
* **Routes IPv6 traffic** directly (IPv6 addresses are globally unique)

### NAT Gateway

A **NAT Gateway is a Network Address Translation service** that allows instances in private subnets to initiate outbound connections to the internet while preventing external hosts from initiating inbound connections. NAT Gateways are created in specific Availability Zones with built-in redundancy.

### NAT Gateway Types

* **Public NAT Gateway**: Enables private subnet instances to connect to the internet
* **Private NAT Gateway**: Enables connections to other VPCs or on-premises networks

### Performance Specifications

* **Bandwidth**: 5 Gbps with automatic scaling up to 100 Gbps
* **Packet Processing**: 1 million packets per second, scaling to 10 million
* **Connections**: Up to 55,000 simultaneous connections per IPv4 address
* **IP Support**: Up to 8 IPv4 addresses (1 primary + 7 secondary)

### Route Tables: Traffic Control

**Route tables serve as the traffic controller for your VPC**, containing a set of rules called routes that determine where network traffic is directed. Each route specifies a **destination CIDR block** and a **target** (such as an Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, or VPC peering connection).

### Route Table Types

| Route Table Type        | Purpose                           | Association                      |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Main Route Table**    | Default table for all subnets     | Automatically created with VPC   |
| **Custom Route Table**  | User-created for specific routing | Manually associated with subnets |
| **Subnet Route Table**  | Associated with specific subnet   | Controls subnet traffic          |
| **Gateway Route Table** | Associated with gateways          | Controls gateway traffic         |

### Security Architecture <a href="#security-architecture" id="security-architecture"></a>

### Security Groups: Instance-Level Firewalls

**Security Groups act as virtual firewalls** that control inbound and outbound traffic at the **instance level**. They are **stateful**, meaning that response traffic for allowed inbound connections is automatically permitted regardless of outbound rules.

Key characteristics of Security Groups:

* **Instance-level protection** (not subnet-level)
* **Stateful operation** - tracks connection state
* **Deny by default** - only allows explicitly permitted traffic
* **Multiple groups per instance** - up to 5 security groups per network interface
* **Cross-VPC association** - can be associated with multiple VPCs in the same region

### Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)

**Network ACLs operate at the subnet level** and provide an additional layer of security. Unlike Security Groups, NACLs are **stateless**, requiring explicit rules for both inbound and outbound traffic. Each VPC comes with a default NACL that allows all inbound and outbound traffic.

### Security Groups vs NACLs Comparison

| Feature        | Security Groups     | Network ACLs             |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Level**      | Instance            | Subnet                   |
| **State**      | Stateful            | Stateless                |
| **Rules**      | Allow rules only    | Allow and deny rules     |
| **Processing** | All rules evaluated | Rules processed in order |
| **Default**    | Deny all inbound    | Allow all traffic        |

### Advanced VPC Features <a href="#advanced-vpc-features" id="advanced-vpc-features"></a>

### VPC Endpoints: Private AWS Service Access

**VPC Endpoints enable private connections to AWS services** without requiring internet gateways, NAT devices, VPN connections, or Direct Connect. Traffic between your VPC and AWS services never leaves the AWS network backbone.

### VPC Endpoint Types

**Interface Endpoints (AWS PrivateLink)**:

* **Elastic Network Interfaces** with private IP addresses
* Support for most AWS managed services
* **Hourly charges** plus data processing fees
* **Subnet-level creation** across multiple Availability Zones

**Gateway Endpoints**:

* **Route table entries** for S3 and DynamoDB
* **No additional charges**
* **VPC-wide accessibility**
* **No dependency on PrivateLink**

### VPC Peering: Inter-VPC Communication

**VPC Peering enables direct communication between two VPCs** using private IP addresses as if they were on the same network. Peering connections can be established between VPCs in the same account, different accounts, or even different regions.

VPC peering connection architecture diagram

### VPC Peering Process

1. **Peering Request**: Requester VPC owner initiates connection request
2. **Acceptance**: Accepter VPC owner accepts the request
3. **Route Configuration**: Both VPCs must update route tables
4. **Security Updates**: Modify security groups and NACLs as needed

### Key Limitations

* **No transitive peering** - VPCs cannot communicate through a third VPC
* **No overlapping CIDR blocks** between peered VPCs
* **DNS resolution** requires specific configuration for cross-VPC hostname resolution

### VPC Architecture Best Practices <a href="#vpc-architecture-best-practices" id="vpc-architecture-best-practices"></a>

### Multi-Tier Architecture Design

For production environments, implement a **multi-tier architecture** with clearly separated layers:

* **Public Subnets**: Web servers and load balancers with internet access
* **Private Subnets**: Application servers with controlled access
* **Database Subnets**: Database servers with no direct internet access

### High Availability and Resilience

* **Deploy across multiple Availability Zones** for fault tolerance
* **Create NAT Gateways in each AZ** to prevent single points of failure
* **Use redundant connections** for critical network paths

### Security Implementation

* **Apply principle of least privilege** in security group rules
* **Use NACLs for subnet-level controls** as defense in depth
* **Implement VPC Flow Logs** for network monitoring and troubleshooting
* **Regular security group audits** to maintain minimal access requirements

### Cost Optimization

* **Use Gateway Endpoints** for S3 and DynamoDB access (no charges)
* **Centralize Interface Endpoints** across multiple VPCs when possible
* **Optimize NAT Gateway usage** by consolidating traffic where appropriate

### Practical Implementation Considerations <a href="#practical-implementation-considerations" id="practical-implementation-considerations"></a>

### CIDR Block Planning

* **Allocate non-overlapping CIDR blocks** for future VPC peering
* **Reserve IP space** for future growth and additional subnets
* **Consider RFC 1918 private address ranges** (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16)

### Monitoring and Troubleshooting

* **Enable VPC Flow Logs** for comprehensive network monitoring
* **Use CloudWatch metrics** for NAT Gateway and VPC Endpoint performance
* **Implement proper tagging strategies** for resource organization

This comprehensive VPC architecture provides the foundation for building secure, scalable, and resilient cloud networks on AWS. Understanding these components and their interactions is essential for designing effective cloud infrastructure that meets both performance and security requirements.
