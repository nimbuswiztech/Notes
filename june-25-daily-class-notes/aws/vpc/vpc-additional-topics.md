## Gateway <a href="#id-08c6" id="id-08c6"></a>

In a general sense, a **gateway serves as a point of entry or access to a particular place**. When it comes to networking and technology, a gateway refers to a **device or software application that connects two distinct networks**, allowing them to communicate.

**Various types of gateways**

**Network Gateway:** This type connects networks with different **communication protocols**, translating data between various network architectures.

**Default Gateway:** In computer networking, **the default gateway is the node assumed to be on the directly connected network for any given IP address not on the same subnet.**

**Router:** Routers often **act as gateways in networks, directing traffic between different networks.**

**API Gateway:** In the realm of web services, an **API gateway is a server serving as an API front-end.** It receives API requests, enforces throttling and security policies, passes requests to the back-end service, and returns responses to the requester.

**Virtual Private Gateway (VGW):** In cloud computing, particularly in AWS, a **Virtual Private Gateway connects a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) to an on-premises network.**

**Customer Gateway (CGW):** In the context of AWS VPNs, the Customer Gateway represents the customer’s side of a VPN connection.

Now we will see **VGW and CGW**

## **Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)** <a href="#id-3822" id="id-3822"></a>

The Virtual Private Gateway (VGW) is a key component in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that f**acilitates secure communication between your on-premises network and your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).**

Let’s break it down a bit:

**Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):** In AWS, a VPC is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It provides a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources.

**Virtual Private Gateway (VGW):** The VGW is the AWS-side endpoint of your VPN connection. It allows you to connect your VPC with your on-premises network or another VPC using a secure IPsec VPN connection.

* Connection to On-Premises Network: If you have resources on your own infrastructure (on-premises data center), you can establish a VPN connection between your on-premises network and the VGW.
* Connection to Another VPC: VGWs can also be used for VPC peering, connecting one VPC to another.

**Secure Communication:** The VPN connection between the VGW and your on-premises network is encrypted, ensuring a secure communication channel over the public internet.

**Routing:** The VGW plays a role in routing traffic between your VPC and your on-premises network. It helps direct traffic appropriately, ensuring that data flows securely between the connected networks.

**Attachment to VPC:** The VGW is attached to a VPC, allowing it to serve as the gateway for that VPC. Multiple VPCs can share the same VGW, enabling connectivity between them.

Virtual Private Gateway is a crucial component for establishing secure and encrypted communication between your AWS resources in a VPC and your on-premises network. It facilitates a **seamless extension of your on-premises infrastructure into the AWS Cloud.**

## Customer Gateway (CGW) <a href="#id-3fe5" id="id-3fe5"></a>

The Customer Gateway (CGW) is a crucial element within Amazon Web Services (AWS), particularly in the setup of **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** connections.

<figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:551/0*veOEP947V3Reqx11.png" alt="" height="162" width="551"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The Customer Gateway serves as the **customer’s endpoint for the VPN connection**, representing the **on-premises side that connects to AWS.**

**On-Premises Network Connection:** Typically, the CGW is a physical device (such as a router or firewall) or a software application situated within the on-premises network infrastructure.

**Secure Communication:** When establishing a VPN connection between the on-premises network and AWS, the CGW takes on the responsibility of creating a secure and encrypted communication channel over the public internet.

**IPsec VPN Connection**: The CGW is instrumental in initiating an IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) VPN connection with the AWS-side Virtual Private Gateway (VGW).

**Configuration Details:** To set up the VPN connection, specific details, including IP addresses and authentication credentials, need to be configured on the CGW.

**Bidirectional Communication:** Facilitating bidirectional communication, the VPN connection allows secure data flow between the on-premises network and AWS resources hosted within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

**High Availability:** For enhanced redundancy and high availability, it’s possible to configure multiple customer gateways.

## VPC Endpoints

A **VPC endpoint** is a feature in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables private connections between your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and supported AWS services or VPC endpoint services. With VPC endpoints, resources in your VPC can access services without traversing the public internet, boosting both security and performance.

### Why Use VPC Endpoints? <a href="#why-use-vpc-endpoints" id="why-use-vpc-endpoints"></a>

* **Eliminate exposure to the public internet:** Resources can communicate with AWS services privately, mitigating risks associated with public access.
* **Reduce latency and data transfer costs:** Traffic stays within AWS infrastructure.
* **Simplify network architecture:** No need for internet gateways, NAT devices, or VPNs for accessing AWS services.

### Types of VPC Endpoints <a href="#types-of-vpc-endpoints" id="types-of-vpc-endpoints"></a>

There are three main types of VPC endpoints, each with distinct use cases and supported services:

| Endpoint Type                      | How It Works                                                                       | Typical Use Cases                    | Supported Services                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Gateway Endpoint**               | Traffic is routed by a target in your VPC’s route table for S3 or DynamoDB         | Data storage, NoSQL access           | Amazon S3, DynamoDB                          |
| **Interface Endpoint**             | Elastic Network Interface (ENI) with a private IP is deployed in your subnet       | Access most AWS services, SaaS, APIs | Wide range: SQS, SNS, KMS, API Gateway, etc. |
| **Gateway Load Balancer Endpoint** | Routes traffic to virtual appliances (e.g., firewalls) via a Gateway Load Balancer | Third-party appliances, security     | Services behind Gateway Load Balancers       |

### 1. Gateway Endpoints

* **Used exclusively for Amazon S3 and DynamoDB.**
* Functions by adding a target to a VPC route table. Instances in your VPC can access S3 or DynamoDB _without public IPs_, and data never leaves AWS’s internal network.
* **No cost to use** (except standard data transfer/storage fees).
* Controlled by **endpoint policies** to limit access to specific resources or workload requirements.

### 2. Interface Endpoints (Powered by AWS PrivateLink)

* **Works for dozens of AWS services** (e.g., API Gateway, SQS, SNS, KMS, Systems Manager, Lambda, and many AWS Marketplace partner/SaaS services).
* Creates **one or more ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces)** with private IPs in your subnets; traffic is directed to these internal IPs for service access.
* Supports security group association for traffic control.
* Use cases: secure API access, connecting to partner SaaS apps, private communications between VPCs.
* **Billing note:** Has an hourly charge plus per-GB data processed.

### 3. Gateway Load Balancer Endpoints

* **Used to connect to virtual appliances** (such as firewalls, intrusion detection, packet inspection) deployed behind Gateway Load Balancers.
* Routes traffic via a central gateway, allowing inspection/scanning before reaching its destination.

### How VPC Endpoints Work <a href="#how-vpc-endpoints-work" id="how-vpc-endpoints-work"></a>

* **For Gateway Endpoints:**
  * Add a route in the VPC route table targeting the endpoint for S3/DynamoDB destination prefixes.
  * Endpoints are tracked via prefix lists for efficient management.
  * No need for public IPs or NAT gateways for private subnets to reach S3/DynamoDB.
* **For Interface Endpoints:**
  * AWS creates ENIs in one or more subnets with private IPs.
  * DNS for the target service is automatically updated to resolve to the local interface endpoint.
  * Security groups control what can connect to the endpoint.
  * IAM endpoint policies can control access granularly.
* **For Gateway Load Balancer Endpoints:**
  * Route table entries send relevant traffic to the endpoint, which then forwards it to a Gateway Load Balancer and its attached appliances.

### Benefits of Using VPC Endpoints <a href="#benefits-of-using-vpc-endpoints" id="benefits-of-using-vpc-endpoints"></a>

* **Enhanced Security:** No internet exposure.
* **Low Latency:** Internal AWS routing is highly optimized.
* **Reduced Data Transfer Costs:** Internal AWS transfers are usually more cost-effective.
* **Simplified Compliance:** Eases requirements for private-only, highly regulated architectures.

### Typical VPC Endpoint Use Cases <a href="#typical-vpc-endpoint-use-cases" id="typical-vpc-endpoint-use-cases"></a>

* **Private access to S3 from private subnets.**
* **Restricting access to AWS services via endpoint policies.**
* **Connecting to third-party services via PrivateLink, without going over the internet.**
* **Meeting regulatory and compliance requirements, especially when internet traffic is forbidden.**
* **Centralized access to security appliances (virtual firewalls, IDS/IPS).**

### Best Practices <a href="#best-practices" id="best-practices"></a>

* **Use endpoint policies** to restrict access as tightly as possible.
* **Enable private DNS** (for interface endpoints) to simplify integration with SDKs and applications.
* **Monitor endpoint usage** to optimize costs and spot unnecessary endpoints.
* **Associate interface endpoints with security groups** for granular access control.
