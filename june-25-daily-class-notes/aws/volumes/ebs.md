&#x20;These scenarios will engage your audience and show how EBS addresses actual cloud challenges.

### 1. Expanding a Running EBS Volume Without Downtime <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

**Scenario:**\
Your production server's disk space is running low during business hours. You need to expand storage without stopping the workload.

**Hands-On Steps:**

* Use the AWS Console to modify and increase the size of the EBS volume attached to a running EC2 instance.
* Connect to the instance (Linux: SSH, Windows: RDP).
* Use `lsblk` and `df -h` (Linux) or Disk Management (Windows) to verify the new volume size.
* Extend the filesystem with `sudo growpart` and `sudo resize2fs` (Linux) or expand the disk partition (Windows).
* Show that the application/data is uninterrupted throughout.

### 2. EBS Snapshots for Backup and Disaster Recovery <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

**Scenario:**\
You must back up your database volume and restore data after accidental deletion.

**Hands-On Steps:**

* Take a snapshot of the active EBS data volume via Console or CLI.
* Simulate “disaster” by deleting files/data on the volume.
* Restore from the snapshot by creating a new volume, attaching to the same or different EC2 instance.
* Mount and recover the data, demonstrating a quick restore process.

### 3. EBS Volume Type Comparison with Benchmarking <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

**Scenario:**\
Selecting the right EBS volume type for different workloads (e.g., general-purpose, high-performance apps).

**Hands-On Steps:**

* Create two EBS volumes of different types (e.g., gp3 vs io2).
* Attach both to a test instance.
* Use a tool like `fio` to benchmark read/write performance.
* Collect and compare results to demonstrate use-case suitability:
  * gp3: Balanced cost/performance.
  * io2: High IOPS for databases or transactional apps.

### 4. EBS Volume Performance Troubleshooting <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

**Scenario:**\
Your application is slower than expected and you suspect a storage bottleneck.

**Hands-On Steps:**

* Use CloudWatch to monitor EBS performance metrics (IOPS, throughput, latency).
* Generate load with a test script or app.
* Identify if volume or instance has hit performance limits.
* Adjust EBS type or switch to provisioned performance and re-measure impact.

### 5. Consistent Deployment Across Environments <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

**Scenario:**\
Application in dev uses less throughput, but production requires high-performance EBS.

**Hands-On Steps:**

* Launch EC2 instances with different EBS volume configurations for dev and prod environments (volume size, type, or initialized from snapshot).
* Demonstrate how the same AMI can scale across environments by adjusting only EBS properties at deployment.

### 6. Automated Data Lifecycle Management <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

**Scenario:**\
You want to automate backup and cost-saving by managing EBS snapshots.

**Hands-On Steps:**

* Set up AWS Data Lifecycle Manager to automatically create, retain, and delete EBS snapshots.
* Show scheduled snapshot creation and automatic cleanup after retention period.

### 7. Testing Application Resiliency (Advanced/Optional) <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

* Invite participants to run each scenario in their own accounts or follow along with a live demo.
* Provide CLI and Console steps, and encourage questions about which scenario suits which real AWS challenge.
* Tie each exercise back to common business cases: growth, disaster recovery, scaling, billing optimization, and security.

Using these real-time, scenario-driven demos will ensure your practical session is interactive and valuable.

## Expanding a Running AWS EBS Volume Without Downtime <a href="#expanding-a-running-aws-ebs-volume-without-downtim" id="expanding-a-running-aws-ebs-volume-without-downtim"></a>

Expanding an EBS volume attached to a running EC2 instance is a common AWS maintenance task that can be performed with zero downtime. Here is a clear, step-by-step guide for both the AWS Console and Linux-based EC2 instances.

### Step-by-Step Guide <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

### 1. Identify the Volume

* Log in to the **AWS Management Console**.
* Go to **EC2 > Instances** and select your running instance.
* Under the **Storage** tab, note the volume ID(s) attached to the instance.

### 2. Modify the EBS Volume

* Navigate to **EC2 > Volumes**.
* Find and select the volume you want to expand.
* Click **Actions > Modify Volume**.
* Enter the new, larger size for the volume.
* Click **Modify**, then **Yes** to confirm.
* Wait until the volume state is **‘optimizing’** or **‘available’**.

### 3. Refresh the Volume in the Operating System

### For Linux Instances:

*   Connect to your instance using SSH:

    ```
    ssh ec2-user@<your-instance-public-ip>
    ```
*   Confirm the attached volumes and their sizes:

    ```
    lsblk
    ```
*   If using a standard partition (not LVM), grow the partition:

    ```
    sudo growpart /dev/xvdf 1
    ```

    Replace `/dev/xvdf` and partition number `1` with your device name, if different.
*   Extend the file system (for `ext4` filesystem):

    ```
    sudo resize2fs /dev/xvdf1
    ```

    If using `xfs`, use:

    ```
    sudo xfs_growfs /mount/point
    ```
*   Check the new size:

    ```
    df -h
    ```

### 4. Validate No Downtime

* Applications/data on the volume should remain available throughout.
* There is **no need to restart the instance** or detach the volume.

### Summary Table <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

| Step        | Console Action                | CLI/OS Action                    |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Identify    | EC2 > Instances > Storage     | `lsblk`                          |
| Modify Vol. | EC2 > Volumes > Modify Volume | N/A                              |
| Grow Part.  | N/A                           | `sudo growpart …`                |
| Expand FS   | N/A                           | `sudo resize2fs` or `xfs_growfs` |
| Verify      | Console shows new vol. state  | `df -h`                          |

### Notes <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

* This process works for both root and additional data volumes.
* For **Windows instances**, use Disk Management to rescan disks and expand the volume in the GUI.
* If using LVM or other filesystems, ensure to run the relevant resizing commands for your configuration.

Following these steps allows seamless expansion of EBS storage on live systems, ensuring continuous availability for your workloads.

## File System Types <a href="#explanation-of-file-system-types" id="explanation-of-file-system-types"></a>

A **file system** defines how data is stored, organized, and accessed on a disk or storage device. On AWS (and in general Linux and Windows environments), the type of file system you use impacts performance, features, compatibility, and suitability for applications.

### Common File System Types <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

### 1. ext4 (Fourth Extended File System)

* Most widely used on modern Linux distributions.
* Supports large files and volumes (up to 1EB, with file sizes up to 16TB).
* Journaling support for crash recovery.
* Efficient and reliable for databases, web servers, and general use.

### 2. XFS

* High-performance 64-bit journaling file system.
* Excellent scalability for both large files and many files.
* Advanced features: online resizing, defragmentation, delayed allocation for better performance.
* Preferred for high-throughput workloads and when large data volumes are needed.

### 3. NTFS (New Technology File System)

* Primary file system for Windows.
* Supports large files and volumes, security features like encryption and permissions (ACLs).
* Journaling for reliability.
* Used when launching Windows EC2 instances.

### 4. FAT32 and exFAT

* FAT32 is supported by almost all operating systems but limited to 4GB file size and 8TB volume size.
* exFAT is suitable for larger files and compatibility across OSes (e.g., for USB sticks, SD cards).
* Not recommended for production servers due to lack of features like journaling and permissions.

### 5. Btrfs

* Advanced Linux file system (not as widely used as ext4 or XFS).
* Supports snapshots, checksumming, and self-healing features.
* Effective for use cases requiring data integrity and snapshotting.

### 6. EFS (Elastic File System) on AWS

* Uses the NFSv4 protocol under the hood.
* Managed, elastic file system for use with AWS EC2.
* Allows simultaneous mount by multiple EC2 instances for shared access.

### Comparison Table <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

| File System | OS Compatibility | Max File Size | Journaling | Common Use                   |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| ext4        | Linux            | 16TB          | Yes        | General purpose, databases   |
| XFS         | Linux            | 8EB           | Yes        | High-throughput applications |
| NTFS        | Windows, Linux\* | 16EB+         | Yes        | Windows servers, apps        |
| FAT32       | All              | 4GB           | No         | Flash drives, cross-platform |
| exFAT       | All              | Large         | No         | Large flash drives, SD cards |
| Btrfs       | Linux            | 16EB          | Yes        | Snapshotting, redundancy     |

\*Modern Linux can read/write NTFS with the right drivers.

### How This Relates to AWS EBS <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

* When attaching a new EBS volume to an EC2 instance, you choose and format the volume with one of these file systems depending on your performance, capacity, and compatibility requirements.
* For Linux servers, **ext4** (default) and **XFS** are most common.
* For Windows, **NTFS** is standard.
* File system choice affects management tasks like snapshotting, backup, and recovery.

**Choosing the right file system ensures reliability, performance, and the right feature set for your application's needs.**
