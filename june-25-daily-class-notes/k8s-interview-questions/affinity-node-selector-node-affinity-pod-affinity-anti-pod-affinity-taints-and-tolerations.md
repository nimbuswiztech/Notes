## Node Selector Questions

### **Scenario 1: Hardware-Specific Workload Deployment**

**Situation**: Your organization has a Kubernetes cluster with mixed node types - some nodes have GPUs for ML workloads, others have high-memory configurations for analytics, and standard nodes for regular applications.

**Question**: How would you ensure that a machine learning pod requiring GPU resources only gets scheduled on GPU-enabled nodes using node selectors?

**Follow-up Questions**:

* What happens if no nodes match the node selector criteria?
* How would you label the nodes to identify GPU-capable machines?
* What are the limitations of using node selectors compared to node affinity?

**Expected Answer Points**:

* Label GPU nodes: `kubectl label nodes gpu-node-1 hardware=gpu`
* Use nodeSelector in pod spec:

```yaml
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    hardware: gpu
```

* Pod remains in Pending state if no matching nodes found
* Node selectors are simple but inflexible (exact match only)

***

### **Scenario 2: Environment Segregation**

**Situation**: You need to separate production and development workloads on different nodes within the same cluster for cost optimization.

**Question**: Design a node labeling strategy and demonstrate how to use node selectors to ensure dev pods never run on production nodes.

**Follow-up Questions**:

* How would you handle a scenario where all development nodes are down?
* What additional safety measures would you implement?

## Node Affinity Questions

### **Scenario 3: Multi-Zone High Availability**

**Situation**: Your e-commerce application needs to be deployed across multiple availability zones, but you prefer certain zones due to lower latency to your database.

**Question**: Implement a node affinity rule that prefers pods to be scheduled in `us-west-2a` zone but allows scheduling in other zones if needed.

**Expected Configuration**:

```yaml
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - weight: 100
        preference:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
            operator: In
            values:
            - us-west-2a
```

**Follow-up Questions**:

* What's the difference between `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` and `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`?
* How does the weight parameter work in preferred affinity?
* When would you use `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`?

***

### **Scenario 4: Instance Type Optimization**

**Situation**: Your microservice has different resource requirements - API pods need compute-optimized instances, while background workers need memory-optimized instances.

**Question**: Create node affinity rules to schedule API pods on c5.large instances and worker pods on r5.large instances.

**Challenge Question**: What happens when you have both required and preferred node affinity rules in the same pod spec?

***

## Pod Affinity Questions

### **Scenario 5: Database and Application Co-location**

**Situation**: You have a Redis cache that needs to be co-located with your web application pods for minimal latency.

**Question**: Implement pod affinity to ensure Redis pods are scheduled on the same nodes as web application pods labeled with `app=web`.

**Expected Configuration**:

```yaml
spec:
  affinity:
    podAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - labelSelector:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: app
            operator: In
            values:
            - web
        topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
```

**Follow-up Questions**:

* What does `topologyKey` represent?
* What other topology keys could you use instead of `kubernetes.io/hostname`?
* How would you handle a scenario where web pods are not yet scheduled?

***

### **Scenario 6: Microservices Communication Optimization**

**Situation**: Your payment service frequently communicates with the user service and needs to be deployed close to each other to reduce network latency.

**Question**: Design a pod affinity strategy to co-locate payment service pods with user service pods in the same availability zone.

**Follow-up Challenge**: How would you modify this if you wanted them in the same zone but preferably on different nodes?

***

## Anti-Pod Affinity Questions

### **Scenario 7: High Availability for Critical Services**

**Situation**: You're deploying a critical database cluster with 3 replicas that must be distributed across different nodes to prevent single point of failure.

**Question**: Implement anti-pod affinity rules to ensure database replicas never run on the same node.

**Expected Configuration**:

```yaml
spec:
  affinity:
    podAntiAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - labelSelector:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: app
            operator: In
            values:
            - database
        topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
```

**Follow-up Questions**:

* What happens if you have only 2 nodes but need to schedule 3 replicas with hard anti-affinity?
* When would you use soft anti-affinity vs hard anti-affinity?
* How does this interact with replica sets?

***

### **Scenario 8: Resource Contention Prevention**

**Situation**: You have CPU-intensive pods that should not be scheduled together to prevent resource contention.

**Question**: Create an anti-affinity rule to distribute CPU-intensive pods across different nodes, but allow scheduling even if preferred placement isn't available.

**Challenge Question**: Design a scenario where you need both pod affinity and anti-affinity rules in the same deployment.

***

## Taints and Tolerations Questions

### **Scenario 9: Dedicated Node Pool Management**

**Situation**: You have a node pool dedicated to running only critical system pods (monitoring, logging, security agents).

**Question**: How would you taint these nodes and configure tolerations to ensure only system pods can run on them?

**Expected Commands and Configuration**:

```bash
kubectl taint nodes system-node-1 dedicated=system:NoSchedule
```

```yaml
spec:
  tolerations:
  - key: dedicated
    operator: Equal
    value: system
    effect: NoSchedule
```

**Follow-up Questions**:

* What's the difference between `NoSchedule`, `PreferNoSchedule`, and `NoExecute` effects?
* How would you remove a taint from a node?
* What happens to existing pods when you apply a `NoExecute` taint?

***

### **Scenario 10: Node Maintenance Workflow**

**Situation**: You need to perform maintenance on a node and want to prevent new pods from being scheduled while allowing existing pods to continue running.

5. Not testing scheduling configurations before production deployment

### **Technical Commands to Know**:

```bash
# Node operations
kubectl get nodes --show-labels
kubectl label nodes <node-name> <key>=<value>
kubectl taint nodes <node-name> <key>=<value>:<effect>
kubectl describe node <node-name>

# Pod scheduling debug
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
