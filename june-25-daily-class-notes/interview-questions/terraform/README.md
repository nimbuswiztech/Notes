# Terraform

## Terraform Basics

### 1.         What is Terraform?

&#x20;

o    Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp. It allows users to define and provision infrastructure using a high- level configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).

&#x20;

### 2.         Explain the difference between Terraform and other configuration management tools like Ansible or Chef.
