# Detailed Explanation

in my recent project, I designed and implemented a **production-grade microservices platform on AWS EKS**, focusing on scalability, security, and operational excellence. I led the architecture and was hands-on in deploying and managing the entire stack with industry best practices.

### Cluster Architecture & Infrastructure

I chose **AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)** for orchestration because it offers a fully managed Kubernetes control plane, abstracting away the complexity of managing master nodes. The control plane is automatically deployed across **three Availability Zones (AZs)** which guarantees high availability and fault tolerance. This design means AWS handles master node patching, failover, and redundancy.

For worker nodes, I provisioned around **10 to 15 EC2 instances**—primarily using the **`t3.medium` and `t3.large`** instance types to balance cost and resource needs. These nodes were evenly distributed across the same three AZs. I set them up in **Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs)** configured with scaling policies based on EC2 CPU utilization and cluster metrics, such as pending pods, ensuring real-time elasticity without manual intervention.

Nodes were bootstrapped with the **Amazon EKS optimized AMI** that comes with Docker, kubelet, and necessary AWS integrations out-of-the-box. For node lifecycle management, I used **Node Termination Handler** to gracefully handle spot instance interruptions and node draining to avoid downtime.

### Microservices Deployment & Configuration

Our platform consisted of approximately **25 independent microservices** running in Kubernetes pods. For each microservice, I created Kubernetes **Deployment YAMLs** specifying:

* **3 to 5 replicas** per service to ensure high availability.
* **Pod anti-affinity rules** to schedule replicas apart both at the node and AZ level to minimize blast radius during failures.
* Defined **resource requests and limits**, mainly between 0.5 to 1 CPU and 512Mi to 1Gi of RAM, balancing workload requirements and cluster cost efficiency.
* Configured **liveness and readiness probes** for health checks, ensuring Kubernetes could detect unhealthy pods and restart them automatically while excluding unready pods from service traffic.
* Leveraged **ConfigMaps** and **Secrets** for configuration management, with Secrets securely injected using Vault.

For container image management, we used **Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)**—images were scanned for vulnerabilities before deployment. CI/CD pipelines were built using **Jenkins** and **AWS CodePipeline**, integrating automated tests and Kubernetes deployment via **kubectl** and **Helm** charts for templated configuration management.

### Security Implementation

I implemented **defense-in-depth** with multiple security layers:

* **AWS Security Groups** were tightly scoped:
  * ALB allowed inbound traffic only on **port 80 (HTTP)** and **443 (HTTPS)** from the public internet or trusted CIDRs.
  * Worker node security groups only accepted traffic from the ALB on application ports (e.g., 8080).
  * MySQL’s security group was locked down to allow port **3306** access exclusively from the worker nodes’ IP range.
* Inside Kubernetes, I enforced **Network Policies** using Calico to enforce pod-to-pod communication restrictions, allowing each microservice to communicate only with its dependencies.
* I integrated **HashiCorp Vault** for secrets management:
  * Vault was deployed in HA mode.
  * Pods authenticated to Vault dynamically via Kubernetes ServiceAccount tokens using the Vault Kubernetes Auth Method.
  * Vault provided dynamic, short-lived credentials for databases, API keys, and TLS certificates, eliminating static secrets and reducing attack surface.
* For ingress security, I deployed the **AWS ALB Ingress Controller**, configured with TLS certificates managed via **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)** for automatic renewals.
* Implemented **rate limiting** and **IP whitelist policies** using ALB rules and AWS WAF for DDoS protection and traffic filtering.

### High Availability & Resilience

* The cluster and worker nodes spanned **three AZs**. This meant in case of an AZ outage, EKS automatically rescheduled pods on healthy nodes without disruption.
* The AWS ALB monitored pod health via configured health checks and only routed traffic to healthy pods.
* The MySQL database was set up on EC2 instances with **multi-AZ synchronous replication** using **Amazon RDS Aurora-compatible MySQL** or self-managed MySQL with Percona XtraDB Cluster for failover.
* Failover scripts and monitoring tools were tuned to promote a healthy replica as primary during outages with minimized manual intervention.
* I implemented **connection pooling** within microservices using **HikariCP**, managing database connection loads efficiently and reducing latency spikes.
* For horizontal scaling, I configured Kubernetes **Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA)**:
  * Autoscaling based on CPU usage and custom application-level metrics exposed via Prometheus exporters.
* At the cluster level, the **Cluster Autoscaler** was enabled to add or remove nodes dynamically as pod resource requests increased or decreased in real time.

### Inter-Service Communication

* Microservices communicated mainly via **RESTful APIs over HTTPS** for synchronous requests.
* For low-latency or internal-heavy communication paths, I implemented **gRPC** using Protocol Buffers for efficient serialization.
* Asynchronous messaging workflows leveraged **Apache Kafka** clusters deployed on separate EC2 instances for event streaming and pub-sub patterns, ensuring loose coupling between services.
* Service discovery was automated by **Kubernetes DNS**, enabling pods to find each other using stable DNS names.

### Logging, Monitoring & Observability

* Logging was handled using the **sidecar logging pattern**, where each pod had a sidecar container running **Fluentd** that collected application logs from a shared volume and streamed them in real time to centralized logging platforms like the **ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** hosted on AWS or **Amazon OpenSearch Service**.
* I deployed **Prometheus** for scraping application and cluster metrics:
  * Set up exporters for node CPU, memory, and custom business metrics.
* Visualized the metrics using **Grafana dashboards**, creating alerting rules to monitor service latency, error rates, and resource exhaustion.
* For tracing requests across microservices, I integrated **Jaeger** as distributed tracing infrastructure, implemented via OpenTelemetry instrumentation in the app code.
* Alerts from Prometheus Alertmanager were integrated with **Slack** and **PagerDuty**, enabling our team to respond promptly to issues.

### Additional Technical Details & Tooling I Used

* Configuration management and deployment templating with **Helm** and **Kustomize**.
* Infrastructure provisioning via **Terraform**, managing EKS clusters, networking (VPC, Subnets, Security Groups), and autoscaling groups.
* GitOps workflows using **Argo CD** for continuous deployment of Kubernetes manifests from source control.
* Monitoring of node and cluster health using **AWS CloudWatch** and **Kubernetes Dashboard**.
* Container security scanning using **Aqua Security** and **Trivy** integrated into the CI pipeline.
* Implemented **blue/green deployment strategies** and **canary releases** using Kubernetes native tools and service mesh (Istio) experiments for zero-downtime deployments.

### Cluster Architecture & Infrastructure (Detailed Experience)

In my project, I architected the Kubernetes cluster using **AWS EKS** primarily due to its managed control plane that significantly reduces operational overhead. AWS provisions and manages the control plane nodes automatically across **3 Availability Zones (AZs)**, ensuring resilience and fault tolerance out of the box.

For the worker nodes:

* I chose **EC2 instances of types `t3.medium` and `t3.large`**, which provided a good balance of CPU, memory, and cost-effectiveness, tailored to handle the diverse workloads of our microservices.
* Each node group was deployed across the same three AZs so in case one AZ suffered from a failure or network issue, the system would remain unaffected by routing workloads to healthy nodes elsewhere.
* I configured **Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs)** with scaling policies based on cluster metrics and node utilization, ensuring that additional nodes are spun up or terminated automatically to meet real-time demand.
* To streamline node lifecycle management and optimize costs, I implemented **spot instance pools** alongside on-demand instances, using tools like **Node Termination Handler** to gracefully drain and replace nodes on spot interruptions.
* I automated provisioning and configuration through **Terraform** scripts that codified the entire VPC setup (private/public subnets per AZ), security groups, Internet gateways, and cluster autoscaling.

I also installed Kubernetes add-ons such as:

* **Cluster Autoscaler**, tuned to watch for pending pods and scale nodes automatically.
* **Kube-proxy** in IPVS mode for enhanced network performance.
* **Calico** as our CNI plugin to enable advanced network policies and enforce security boundaries.

### Microservices Deployment & Configuration (In-Depth)

During deployment, I took a methodical approach to ensure reliability and efficiency:

* I containerized each microservice using **Docker**, following best practices like multi-stage builds to optimize image size and security.
* Container images were stored in **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**. We integrated image vulnerability scanning using tools like **Trivy** integrated in CI pipelines to detect risks before deployment.
* I used **Helm charts** and sometimes **Kustomize** for templating Kubernetes manifests, enabling us to maintain different configurations for environments (dev/stage/prod) while keeping the core YAML reusable and manageable.
* Defined **resource requests and limits** carefully for each pod based on profiling and load testing to avoid resource starvation or waste, which optimized cluster utilization.
* Configured **readiness probes** that delay routing traffic to a pod until it's fully initialized, and **liveness probes** that periodically check pod health and restart failed containers automatically—critical for maintaining uptime in production.
* Implemented **pod anti-affinity rules** to prevent multiple replicas of the same service from landing on the same node or AZ, reducing risk of correlated failure.
* Used **ConfigMaps** for non-sensitive configuration data, and integrated with **HashiCorp Vault** via the Vault Agent Injector webhook for injecting sensitive secrets at runtime dynamically and securely.
* For deployments, I set up **rolling updates** with controlled max unavailable and surge parameters, allowing zero-downtime update rollouts.
* Integrated **Prometheus custom metrics exporters** inside microservices to emit business and operational metrics alongside node/container stats.

### High Availability & Resilience (Advanced Real-World Approach)

Ensuring continuous uptime and reliability was a major focus:

* I designed the cluster and application architecture for **multi-AZ high availability**. Worker nodes and pods were spread across AZs to mitigate capacity loss or failures isolated to a single data center.
* Implemented **Kubernetes pod disruption budgets (PDBs)** to control the minimum number of replicas always available during maintenance windows or cluster upgrades.
* Leveraged **Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA)** that adjust pod replica count based on CPU utilization or external/custom metrics collected through Prometheus Adapter, enabling microservices to automatically scale with user demand spikes and shrink during quiet periods—this dynamic scaling helped us optimize costs without compromising performance.
* At the infrastructure level, the **Cluster Autoscaler** added or removed nodes transparently based on pod scheduling pressure and resource requests, ensuring pods were never stuck in pending states.
* For the database layer, I set up **MySQL instances running in a multi-AZ configuration** with synchronous replication where possible and asynchronous replicas in distant regions for disaster recovery.
* Implemented resilient failover using automated scripts integrated with Amazon Route 53 health checks to promote replica nodes to primary with minimal downtime.
* Employed **connection pooling libraries (e.g., HikariCP)** in our Java-based services to reduce overhead from frequent connection creation and mitigate database load spikes.
* The ingress controller using **AWS Application Load Balancer** integrated with Kubernetes was configured for cross-AZ load balancing and health checks, routing traffic away from any unhealthy pods or nodes.
* Configured **self-healing mechanisms** like pod restarts and node replacement that dynamically address faults without manual intervention.
* To monitor availability SLAs, I set up alerts and dashboards tracking pod readiness, node health, request error rates, and latency—with automated incident creation via PagerDuty for quick reaction to failures.
