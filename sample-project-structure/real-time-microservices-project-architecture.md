# Real-Time Microservices Project Architecture

## **Real-Time Microservices Project Architecture (AWS EKS-Based)** <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

This setup represents a **production-grade, cloud-native microservices architecture** deployed on **AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**. The design is aligned with real-world industry practices focusing on **scalability, security, high availability, and observability**.

***

### 1. **Cluster Architecture & Infrastructure** <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

* **Control Plane (Masters):**
  * Provided by **AWS EKS**, fully managed and deployed across **3 Availability Zones (AZs)**.
  * Highly available, automatically patched, and managed by AWS (teams donâ€™t handle master nodes directly).
* **Worker Nodes:**
  * Typically **10â€“15 EC2 nodes** (`t3.medium` or `t3.large`) depending on load.
  * Distributed across **3 AZs** for fault tolerance.
  * Nodes grouped into **Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs)** â†’ automatically add/remove nodes during spikes or failures.
  * Critical workloads often use **taints/tolerations** to reserve capacity.

***

### 2. **Microservices Deployment** <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

* Around **25+ independent microservices** run as **Kubernetes pods**.
* Each has **3â€“5 replicas** for high availability.
* **Pod anti-affinity rules** â†’ ensures replicas donâ€™t run on the same node/AZ.
* **Resource quotas** set per pod:
  * 0.5â€“1 vCPU
  * 512Miâ€“1Gi RAM
* **Health Checks:**
  * **Readiness probes** â†’ ensure only healthy pods receive traffic.
  * **Liveness probes** â†’ auto-restart crashed containers.

***

### 3. **Security Implementation (Real-Time Best Practices)** <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

* **Network Security:**
  * **AWS Security Groups**:
    * ALB â†’ open only on ports **80 & 443**.
    * Worker Nodes â†’ accept traffic only from ALB.
    * Database (MySQL) â†’ restricted to worker node IP ranges.
  * **Kubernetes Network Policies**:
    * Enforce **zero-trust** communication (only required pods/services talk).
    * Prevents lateral movement if one service is compromised.
* **Secrets Management:**
  * **HashiCorp Vault** issues **dynamic, short-lived secrets** for:
    * DB connections
    * API keys
    * Certificates
  * No secrets stored in code, configs, or container images â†’ reduces leakage risks.
* **Ingress & TLS Security:**
  * **AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)** handles external traffic.
  * **TLS termination** with **AWS Certificate Manager**.
  * Configurable **rate limiting, WAF (Web Application Firewall), and IP allowlists** for added protection.

***

### 4. **High Availability & Scaling** <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

* **Cluster HA:**
  * Multi-AZ deployment ensures resilience.
  * If one AZ/node fails, pods reschedule automatically in another AZ, and ALB reroutes traffic.
* **Database HA:**
  * MySQL runs on EC2 with **multi-AZ replication** (primary + replica).
  * Automatic failover promotes a replica if primary fails.
  * Connection pooling (HikariCP, PgBouncer, etc.) reduces DB load spikes.
* **Scalability:**
  * **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA):**
    * Scales services up/down based on CPU & custom app metrics.
  * **Cluster Autoscaler:**
    * Adds/removes worker nodes as needed (real-time elasticity).

***

### 5. **Service Communication** <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

* **Primary Protocols:**
  * **REST APIs over HTTPS** â†’ standard for most microservices.
  * **gRPC** used for low-latency, high-performance internal services.
  * **Kafka / RabbitMQ** for asynchronous, event-driven communication.
* **Service Discovery:**
  * Handled by **Kubernetes DNS** â†’ services resolve each other dynamically.
* **API Gateway / Ingress Controller:**
  * Routes, authenticates, and secures traffic internally and externally.
  * Adds features like request throttling & centralized auth (OAuth, JWT).

***

### 6. **Logging, Monitoring & Observability** <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

* **Logging:**
  * Each pod runs a **sidecar logging agent** (e.g., Fluentd/Fluent Bit).
  * Logs collected from app â†’ shipped to **ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** or managed service like **CloudWatch / OpenSearch**.
* **Monitoring:**
  * **Prometheus** scrapes metrics (CPU, memory, custom app metrics).
  * **Grafana** â†’ visualization dashboards & business KPIs.
* **Tracing:**
  * **Jaeger / Zipkin** integrated for distributed tracing.
  * Helps debug latency & request flows across microservices.
* **Alerting:**
  * Integrated with **Alertmanager / PagerDuty / Slack** to notify DevOps of incidents in real time.

### ðŸ”‘ Why This Architecture is **Real & Practical**

* **Managed Control Plane (EKS):** Most production teams prefer leaving master node operations to AWS.
* **Multi-AZ Deployment:** Industry-standard to avoid downtime.
* **Zero-Trust Networking (SG + Network Policies):** Matches enterprise security compliance.
* **Sidecar Logging:** Used almost everywhere to decouple logging from apps.
* **Vault Integration:** Prevents secret sprawl and rotation headaches.
* **Auto Scaling (Pods + Nodes):** Automatically tracks **real customer demand**.
* **ALB with TLS:** Common industry pattern for ingress + security.

ðŸ‘‰ This setup mirrors what **actual organizations (fintechs, SaaS, e-commerce, AI-driven apps)** deploy on AWS for production workloads today.
